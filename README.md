# Customer-Churn-Prediction  using the telco customer churn

**Problem Description :**


The Telco Customer Churn dataset consists of data from a telecommunications company. The objective 
of this project is to predict customer churn, which is when a customer cancels their service or stops 
doing business with a company. The dataset contains information about customer demographics, 
account information, services used, and whether or not the customer churned. The goal of this project is 
to build a model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn, so that the company 
can take steps to prevent it.


**Dataset**

The dataset can be found on Kaggle.

**Approach:**

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing.

**Technical Aspect:**

1)Cleaning the data by detecting outliers, deleting the null values, changing the format of some columns to correct format,etc.

2)Visualizing the data using various modules such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3)Built a Logistic Regression model and Evaluated the model using AUROC Score.


**Requirements:**

• Python 3.x

• Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab.

• Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn.
